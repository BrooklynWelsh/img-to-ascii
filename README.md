# Image to ASCII Converter

Next.js/TailwindCSS site that takes in an image and converts it to ASCII.

## How to Use

This repo comes with a pnpm-lock.yaml file, so if you don't have `pnpm` installed follow the installation instructions for your system [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Then:
- `pnpm ci`
- `pnpm run start`

If you just want to use `npm`, you can ignore the pnpm file and instead:
- `npm i`
- `npm run start`
